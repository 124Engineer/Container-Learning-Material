# Daemon sets

- We want to scale `rng` in a way that is different from how we scaled `worker`

- We want one (and exactly one) instance of `rng` per node

- What if we just scale up `deploy/rng` to the number of nodes?

  - nothing guarantees that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly

  - if we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`

  - if we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

- Instead of a `deployment`, we will use a `daemonset`

---

## Daemon sets in practice

- Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

  - `kube-proxy`

  - `weave` (our overlay network)

  - monitoring agents

  - hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)

  - etc.

- They can also be restricted to run [only on some nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#running-pods-on-only-some-nodes)

---

## Creating a daemon set

- Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.9, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

--

- More precisely: it doesn't have a subcommand to create a daemon set

--

- But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
  ```

--

- How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

--

  - option 1: read the docs

--

  - option 2: `vi` our way out of it

---

## Creating the YAML file for our daemon set

- Let's start with the YAML file for the current `rng` resource

.exercise[

- Dump the `rng` resource in YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml --export >rng.yml 
  ```

- Edit `rng.yml`

]

Note: `--export` will remove "cluster-specific" information, i.e.:
- namespace (so that the resource is not tied to a specific namespace)
- status and creation timestamp (useless when creating a new resource)
- resourceVersion and uid (these would cause... *interesting* problems)

---

## "Casting" a resource to another

- What if we just changed the `kind` field?

  (It can't be that easy, right?)

.exercise[

- Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: DaemonSet`

- Save, quit

- Try to create our new resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
  ```

]

--

We all knew this couldn't be that easy, right!

---

## Understanding the problem

- The core of the error is:
  ```
  error validating data:
  [ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
  unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
  ...
  ```

--

- *Obviously,* it doesn't make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

--

- Workaround: fix the YAML

  - remove the `replicas` field
  - remove the `strategy` field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
  - remove the `status: {}` line at the end

--

- Or, we could also ...

---

## Use the `--force`, Luke

- We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

- The `--force` flag's actual name is `--validate=false`

.exercise[

- Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
  ```

]

--

üé©‚ú®üêá

--

Wait ... Now, can it be *that* easy?

---

## Checking what we've done

- Did we transform our `deployment` into a `daemonset`?

.exercise[

- Look at the resources that we have now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We have both `deploy/rng` and `ds/rng` now!

--

And one too many pods...

---

## Explanation

- You can have different resource types with the same name

  (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemonset* both named `rng`)

- We still have the old `rng` *deployment*

- But now we have the new `rng` *daemonset* as well

- If we look at the pods, we have:

  - *one pod* for the deployment

  - *one pod per node* for the daemonset

---

## What are all these pods doing?

- Let's check the logs of all these `rng` pods

- All these pods have a `run=rng` label:

  - the first pod, because that's what `kubectl run` does
  - the other ones (in the daemon set), because we
    *copied the spec from the first one*

- Therefore, we can query everybody's logs using that `run=rng` selector

.exercise[

- Check the logs of all the pods having a label `run=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=rng --tail 1
  ```

]

--

It appears that *all the pods* are serving requests at the moment.

---

## The magic of selectors

- The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods

- This set of pods is defined as "pods having the label `run=rng`"

.exercise[

- Check the *selector* in the `rng` service definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service rng
  ```

]

When we created additional pods with this label, they were
automatically detected by `svc/rng` and added as *endpoints*
to the associated load balancer.

---

## Removing the first pod from the load balancer

- What would happen if we removed that pod, with `kubectl delete pod ...`?

--

  The `replicaset` would re-create it immediately.

--

- What would happen if we removed the `run=rng` label from that pod?

--

  The `replicaset` would re-create it immediately.

--

  ... Because what matters to the `replicaset` is the number of pods *matching that selector.*

--

- But but but ... Don't we have more than one pod with `run=rng` now?

--

  The answer lies in the exact selector used by the `replicaset` ...

---

## Deep dive into selectors

- Let's look at the selectors for the `rng` *deployment* and the associated *replica set*

.exercise[

- Show detailed information about the `rng` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deploy rng
  ```

- Show detailed information about the `rng` replica:
  <br/>(The second command doesn't require you to get the exact name of the replica set)
  ```bash
  kubectl describe rs rng-yyyy
  kubectl describe rs -l run=rng
  ```

]

--

The replica set selector also has a `pod-template-hash`, unlike the pods in our daemon set.

---

# Updating a service through labels and selectors

- What if we want to drop the `rng` deployment from the load balancer?

- Option 1: 

  - destroy it

- Option 2: 

  - add an extra *label* to the daemon set

  - update the service *selector* to refer to that *label*

--

Of course, option 2 offers more learning opportunities. Right?

---

## Add an extra label to the daemon set

- We will update the daemon set "spec"

- Option 1:

  - edit the `rng.yml` file that we used earlier

  - load the new definition with `kubectl apply`

- Option 2: 

  - use `kubectl edit`

--

*We've included a few hints on the next slides for your convenience!*

---

## We've put resources in your resources

- Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

- There is a difference between:

  - the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning)

  - the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)

  - the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template` block)

- You need to update the selector and the template (metadata labels are not mandatory)

- The template must match the selector

  (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

---

## Adding our label

- Let's add a label `isactive: yes`

- In YAML, `yes` should be quoted; i.e. `isactive: "yes"`

.exercise[

- Update the daemon set to add `isactive: "yes"` to the selector and template label:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit daemonset rng
  ```

- Update the service to add `isactive: "yes"` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

]

---

## Checking what we've done

.exercise[

- Check the logs of all `run=rng` pods to confirm that exactly one per node is now active:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=rng
  ```

]

The timestamps should give us a hint about how many pods are currently receiving traffic.

.exercise[

- Look at the pods that we have right now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

---

## Cleaning up

- The pods of the "old" daemon set are still running

- We are going to identify them programmatically

.exercise[

- List the pods with `run=rng` but without `isactive=yes`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l run=rng,isactive!=yes
  ```

- Remove these pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l run=rng,isactive!=yes -o name |
      xargs kubectl delete
  ```

]

---

## Avoiding extra pods

- When we changed the definition of the daemon set, it immediately created new pods

- How could we have avoided this?

--

- By adding the `isactive: "yes"` label to the pods before changing the daemon set!

- This can be done programmatically with `kubectl patch`:

  ```bash
    PATCH='
    metadata:
      labels:
        isactive: "yes"
    '
    kubectl get pods -l run=rng -o name |
      xargs kubectl patch -p "$PATCH" 
  ```

---

## Labels and debugging

- When a pod is misbehaving, we can delete it: another one will be recreated

- But we can also change its labels

- It will be removed from the load balancer (it won't receive traffic anymore)

- Another pod will be recreated immediately

- But the problematic pod is still here, and we can inspect and debug it

- We can even re-add it to the rotation if necessary

  (Very useful to troubleshoot intermittent and elusive bugs)

---

## Labels and advanced rollout control

- Conversely, we can add pods matching a service's selector

- These pods will then receive requests and serve traffic

- Examples:

  - one-shot pod with all debug flags enabled, to collect logs

  - pods created automatically, but added to rotation in a second step
    <br/>
    (by setting their label accordingly)

- This gives us building blocks for canary and blue/green deployments
